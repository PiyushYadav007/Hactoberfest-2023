# What is Hacktoberfest?

Every October, Digital Ocean runs Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open-sourced software. Encouraging developers at all stages in their careers to participate in the open-source community. The event is open to everyone in the global community, no matter your skill level or background and it grows in size every year.

Hacktoberfest 2023 returns to ZTM with three brand new projects for you to complete the challenge and earn your [digital reward](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#digital-rewards) All you have to do to take part is:

1. Sign up on the [Official Hacktoberfest Website](https://hacktoberfest.com/auth)
2. If you are new to making github contributions: check out the step-by-step process below and the [Getting Started Repository](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines)
3. Make 4 **quality** pull requests to any **participating** public repository during the month of October (ZTM has 3 open source projects you can contribute to for Hacktoberfest)
4. Start chatting with other ZTM students about the projects in the #hacktoberfest-2023 channel on our Discord. Get help or help others!
5. Have fun

This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will have a tree planted in their name!
